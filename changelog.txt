V4.5 - 28 APRIL 2020
	* Minor update
	1) Updated camera rotation code to use Scipy (v1.4) coordinate rotation math
	2) Added QT "Worker" code and rearraged the core code to allow for multithreading
		-- Progress bar, GUI process text work now (they never did before
		-- Also improves performance a little too


V4.0 - 26 JUNE 2019
	* Major update based on new publication (below)
	1) Minor speed improvments
	2) Added the ability to export/import camera IVOF footprints
		-- Outputs Pickle (*.pkl) file of IVOF geometry objects (Matplotlib paths)
		-- Input of "pre-calculated" cameras
	3) Added additional options boxes:
		-- Extra Point Stats: Additional statisitacal output for depth calculations
		-- Small angle Approx: Outputs the small angle approximation correction 
								(apparent depth * refractive index)
		-- Extra Camera Outputs: will output extra debugging tables for the first 
									batch (10000)of points. Full numpy array 
									tables of Camera angle/distance, point angles, 
									depth/elev. calculations.
									Outputs will be in the output folder.
		-- Filtered depth values: allows user to set a filter threshold for max 
									camera angles and point camera distance.
